# Pacman

Hi there! Welcome to my Pacman game. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work â€” this project reflects my skills, curiosity, and problem-solving mindset.

## About This Project

This is a system-level Pacman application developed by me and my team of 5. We built it to:

- Practice and apply our knowledge of **Java** and **object-oriented programming**
- Familiarize ourselves with **Gradle** (build automation) and the **MVC architecture**
- Implement modern features such as **Multiplayer mode**, **Infinity mode**, and **Random map generation**
- Optimize performance and explore new **design patterns** while preserving the retro spirit of the original game

### Tech Stack  
**Java**, **Gradle**, **JavaFX**
